    <p>My name is John Gotz and I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota Duluth. I graduated with a major 
      in Actuarial Science and a minor in Economics. I am so happy that I chose to attend school in Duluth. Growing up, 
      it was always my favorite place to visit with my family. I had a lot of fun exploring the lakeshore with my friends 
      in the fall and summer. One thing I will not miss about Duluth was how cold and long the winter was. Even though I 
      grew up in Minnesota, Duluth still feels like the far north.

      I also love to spend time with my dog. He is a german shepherd mix and he always has so much energy. He loves to run 
      and play tug-of-war! I also like to spend time with my friends and try out new restaurants. There were so many good 
      restaurants to try out in Duluth. My favorite one is OMC Steakhouse. I am also a big football fan and I love to go to 
      Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the games. One of my favorite things to do in the summer is to visit Canterbury Park in 
      Shakopee and see the horse races.
